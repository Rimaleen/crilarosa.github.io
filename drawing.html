                <img src="images/angel1.jpg" class="thumbnail" data-full="images/angel.jpg" alt="Angel" data-desc="Angel is a random drawing from the sketchbook, it has no real name or purpose but may return in the future.">
                <img src="images/heiden1.jpg" class="thumbnail" data-full="images/heiden.png" alt="Heiden" data-desc="He is one of the oldest characters in the gallery. I still plan to delve deeper into his character design, but what I can say is that he wasn't always a positive character, as his original design featured him offering an apple for dark purposes.">
                <img src="images/solarx1.jpg" class="thumbnail" data-full="images/solarx.jpg" alt="Solarx" data-desc="He's a savage who belongs to a nomadic tribe that worships a sun deity, which is why his name comes from that. He also started out as a random sketch from a sketchbook, and he too needs further refinement.">
                <img src="images/hila1.jpg" class="thumbnail" data-full="images/hila.jpg" alt="Hila" data-desc="She's a shaman who also came out of the sketchbook that I then decided to redo digitally.">
                <img src="images/odinne1.jpg" class="thumbnail" data-full="images/odinne.jpg" alt="Odinne" data-desc="I created Odinne for a project with an art group where I had to create an OC based on a letter of the alphabet. And this music-loving mermaid came out, creating almost magical notes.">
                <img src="images/shifune1.jpg" class="thumbnail" data-full="images/shifune.jpg" alt="Shifune" data-desc="This is the character that came out of one of my recent nicknames on a game, and it still needs to be fully characterized. In fact, this is a drawing that came out on impulse.">
                <img src="images/barb1.jpg" class="thumbnail" data-full="images/barb.jpg" alt="The Barbarian Girl" data-desc="It's one of my first digital drawings, I didn't really characterize her per se but it's the basis for one of my D&D characters (Nara'hi).">
                <img src="images/god1.jpg" class="thumbnail" data-full="images/god.jpg" alt="The Goddess" data-desc="It's one of the last drawings I did but it's the basis for another of my D&D characters (Nyxiria).">
                <img src="images/jacob1.jpg" class="thumbnail" data-full="images/jacob.jpg" alt="Jacob" data-desc="He's a character from a D&D oneshot. He's a paladin, but he hates poor people. He's not 100% good, but it was a challenge to maintain his character until the end.">
                <img src="images/zane1.jpg" class="thumbnail" data-full="images/zane.png" alt="Zane" data-desc="He's a warrior angel, an NPC for a D&D campaign where my character was her lost sweetheart who died but was then brought back by the Angel of Union. I didn't include her herself because I plan to revise her character design even though the campaign has concluded (fortunately well).">

            <img src="images/dahala1.jpg" class="thumbnail" data-full="images/dahala.jpg" alt="Dahala & Picus" data-desc="My longest-running character in D&D is a 16-year-old tiefling girl named Dahala. She's always with her little pink ferret cat named Picus, who is a part of her. As his pyro powers have evolved, Picus has also evolved over time. The campaign in which Dahala and Picus are involved is still ongoing as of 2022.">
            <img src="images/narahi1.jpg" class="thumbnail" data-full="images/narahi.jpg" alt="Nara'hi" data-desc="Still in the D&D world where I play as Dahala, I've also participated in several one-shots. One of them featured this seven-foot-tall barbarian elf who wielded a snow shark tooth as her weapon (yes, there were sharks swimming in the thick snow of the snowy desert).">
            <img src="images/german1.jpg" class="thumbnail" data-full="images/german.jpg" alt="Fafnir" data-desc="I made this gnome for a friend. It's a gnome who, every time he swung his huge sword, flew with it. He had a pet cockroach named Alfred.">
            <img src="images/lin1.jpg" class="thumbnail" data-full="images/lin.jpg" alt="Lin'Alya Crystax" data-desc="She's a dragonborn inspired somewhat by the Au'ra design from Final Fantasy Online. She's a cleric of the order of Picarius (Red) and is part of the same world as the Dahala campaign. I created this character to join a group B that no longer exists. Her story ended quite well for her, so nice!">
            <img src="images/axium1.jpg" class="thumbnail" data-full="images/axium.jpg" alt="Axium Edycrem" data-desc="He is an expert in elemental magic who was cursed by a witch with the Neverland curse. This reverted him to a child with half of his actual abilities. A book lover and a keen scholar, he began his journey through the countryside in search of a way to break the curse, only to end up having to save the world from the awakening of the Demon King.">
            <img src="images/elesis1.jpg" class="thumbnail" data-full="images/elesis.jpg" alt="Elesis Tidewave" data-desc="She is a fish woman of the order of Blue, the deity of Oceania. She is also part of the campaign world where Dahala is present and is the character who replaced Lin (the dragonborn). She is a monk who fights with Jinbee-style karate from One Piece. She is also currently in progress.">
            <img src="images/axely1.jpg" class="thumbnail" data-full="images/axely.jpg" alt="Axely Kae'Rin" data-desc="A little kleptomaniac thief who can't keep her hands off things. She was also supposed to be in a campaign, but it didn't pan out, but she's still there, ready to go if another opportunity arises.">
            <img src="images/xiune1.jpg" class="thumbnail" data-full="images/xiune.jpg" alt="Xiu'ne" data-desc="This is also a character who hasn't yet had the chance to be roleplayed in a proper campaign. The idea was for a character similar to One Piece's Lunarian, and his class would be half physical and half magical, like a magical swordsman. Here, I tried to maintain a slightly rougher drawing style.">
            <img src="images/kael1.jpg" class="thumbnail" data-full="images/kael.jpg" alt="Kael Gravargr" data-desc="He's a barbarian who draws power from his ancestors when he enter in rage. The one-shot is set in a post-apocalyptic world where humanoids are few and far between, and he traveled with a group in search of safety. He's married to an elf named Irime. The one-shot ended well, and he lived a fulfilling life, more or less.">
            <img src="images/kuro1.jpg" class="thumbnail" data-full="images/kuro.jpg" alt="Kuro" data-desc="She's an assassin I designed quite a few years ago and recreated digitally. I need to delve deeper into the character design, but I had very clear ideas: she was created for a fantasy world where she was reincarnated and could move at will like a shadow.">
            <img src="images/nyxiria1.jpg" class="thumbnail" data-full="images/nyxiria.jpg" alt="Nyxiria" data-desc="The latest character I created for a new campaign I'm starting. She's a reverse warlock, meaning she's the patron who plays the campaign, but she's lost her powers and needs to regain them. She doesn't fight herself, but she tends to summon her warriors to do her work for her.">

This is one of those that I've carried over to this day, not only with actual writing but also with many sketches. They still need to be refined, but Kasuma and Katsume Bloodline are and always will be those characters awaiting a complete character design, which I'm currently working on.
The story tells of these two vampire brothers and how they turned the life of one of their classmates upside down.">
            <img src="images/rolant1.jpg" class="thumbnail" data-full="images/rolant.jpg" alt="Rolant Albeth Micondih" data-desc="He's an NPC from the same campaign I'm running with Dahala. I was creating a more personal character design, taking inspiration from an AI-generated image. Rolant is the youngest to join the Navy, rising to Admiral. He's the favorite of a goddess named Luxilia, and for this reason, she's been entrusted with a guardian angel.">
            <img src="images/sum1.jpg" class="thumbnail" data-full="images/sum.jpg" alt="Warrior" data-desc="It's still a very undefined project, but I still wanted to include it as a concept because it was progressing quite well.">
